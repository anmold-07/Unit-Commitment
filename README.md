# Unit-Commitment

The codes in this folder are part of the assignment for the course EEPE41 - Power System Economics and Control Techniques at NIT Tiruchirappalli, India. This  mini-project is based on a simple priority-list method taking into account the full-load average production cost. Also, this commitment scheme ignores the min up-/downtime, start-up costs. This MATLAB code gives a visual representation of the number of generators commited at any particular time instant. 


This question is part of Case-1: in the book "POWER GENERATION, OPERATION, AND CONTROL" by Allen J. Wood, 
Bruce F. Wollenberg.
